      <p><strong>Stay-at-home order</strong> <br>At the end of March, <strong>42 states</strong> and more cities and counties were under stay-at-home orders — a total of <strong>308 million people</strong>, or <strong>94%</strong> of the US population. Researchers surveyed nearly <strong>2000 children</strong> in second through sixth grade both in Wuhan, China and in a city about 50 miles away. After an average of <strong>34 days</strong> under the lockdown, <strong>23%</strong> of the kids reported symptoms of <strong>depression</strong>. <strong>19%</strong> reported symptoms of <strong>anxiety</strong>.Until April 26th, some <strong>99% of the world’s children</strong> are living with <strong>restrictions on movement</strong> because of Covid-19. <strong>60%</strong> live in countries under full or partial coronavirus lockdowns. Until June 4th, <strong>190 countries</strong> have imposed countrywide school closures, affecting more than <strong>1.6 billion</strong> children and youth.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-19">Inspiration &amp; Prototyping</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-50">
      <p>We referenced to current intelligent kids physical toys like <a href="https://www.tinkamo.com/" target="_blank">Tinkamo</a> and <a href="#https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/mindstorms" target="_blank">Lego Mindstorms</a>. Then we generated some features to include in our own kids toy design:<a href="#"><strong></strong></a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-49">
      <p class="paragraph-19">- Narrow down the age rage to <strong>2-5/3-5</strong>, for which kids can <strong>communicate</strong> better.<br>- There should be no screen/non-necessary screen for the toy. <br>- <strong>Best without a digital screen or app.<br>- </strong>Kids need to <strong>co-create/compete and win</strong>. (design good game system)<br>- Consider <strong>different kinds of blocks</strong> such as sound blocks…<br>- <strong>Mother Block</strong> (the special one): more complex, embedded <strong>Android</strong> system, <strong>Bluetooth/Wifi</strong>, reads <strong>RFID</strong> tags on children blocks. <br>- Design a <strong>game system</strong> for the toy. <br>- Engagement should be <strong>virtualizing play-date</strong>.<br>- Use <strong>wood/natural</strong> materials (parents prefer).Realize <strong>audio synchronization</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="paragraph-20">With these perspective considered, we summarized the description for our product:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-49">
      <p class="paragraph-19">- An electronic mat (80cm*120cm): To replace electronic screens, embedded LED, sound box and vibration units.<br>- Several electronic blocks (size TBD) Embedded LED to present different colors(magnet?)<br>- Comes with an app downloaded in parents’ phone: Match the phone with the mat and blocks. Connect with friends’ setChoose/Switch games</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 class="heading-19">Gameplay Design</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We ideated 6 gameplay experiences that would work on our blocks:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-51"><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.41.33-PM.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 60vw, (max-width: 991px) 436.796875px, 564px" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.41.33-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.41.33-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.41.33-PM-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.41.33-PM.png 1178w" alt="" class="image-35"></div>
    <div>
      <p>Then we narrowed down to the two games that are most intriguing and intuitive for young kids:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Color Mixing</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Color mixing can be a <strong>single/dual game</strong>. Each block represents <strong>one unique color</strong> with an extra <strong>eraser</strong> block. When the blocks are layered together, the color of the grid will be the <strong>mixed color</strong> of all the blocks above it. The eraser block would <strong>wipe the color</strong> of the grid where it is placed on. When in dual game mode, kids <strong>work together</strong> and could make changes to any painted/unpainted grids by layering blocks over it.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-52"><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.53.44-PM.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 80vw, (max-width: 991px) 582.390625px, 752px" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.53.44-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.53.44-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.53.44-PM-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.53.44-PM.png 1284w" alt="" class="image-36"></div>
    <div>
      <h3>Let There Be Light</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>When two kids are playing together, one kid’s blocks play the role of <strong>mirror</strong> to reflect the light of the torch, while another kid’s blocks are the <strong>shovel</strong> to clean out the path of the light to get it through. There are also two extra blocks that one acts as the torch and another is the receiver the light should finally reach.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-52"><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.55.48-PM.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 80vw, (max-width: 991px) 582.390625px, 752px" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.55.48-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.55.48-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-9.55.48-PM.png 882w" alt="" class="image-36"></div>
